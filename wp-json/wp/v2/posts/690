It taught us several concepts viz. \u201cBody Language, Eye movement, Negotiation styles such as Good cop- Bad Cop etc\u201d. I am assuming most of the sales reps become good in their observation skills over time. So, I won\u2019t go deeper into the above.<\/p><p>Based on my own selling\/team-management experience and working closely with diverse Sales Organizations, I have tried to capture key differences in traits between \u201cBest\u201d Sales Professionals and the \u201cRest\u201d in their ability to manage \u201cnegotiation\u201d. I am not claiming following to be always true. Just that, it pains to see \u201cHardworking Sales reps\u201d at times giving away steep discount. Had they played their cards well (still maintaining win-win with their customers) and prepared a bit more, their company\u2019s margins could have been better. Following is based on my learning.
