There is a reason why most sales interventions become \u201cfavour of the month\u2019 and don\u2019t yield the expected results. Many sales enablement interventions fizzle out post-training interventions or are just too complex to roll out across the sales organization. Not much planning or thought process is given into the overall implementation plan (including risks associated, potential resistance from sales team\/ leaders, right timing, blessing from the key leader etc ).<\/p><p>The following matrix I have prepared is based on our experience of being part of multiple \u201cSales Interventions\u201d initiatives.<\/p><p>Whenever we do sales interventions lately, we brainstorm with customers to think of all possible interventions in the following matrix :<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-dc67209 elementor-widget elementor-widget-image\" data-id=\"dc67209\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"image.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" src=\"https:\/\/salesprofit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Sales-Intervention-Complexity-Potential-Matrix-new.jpg\" class=\"attachment-full size-full wp-image-2275\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https:\/\/salesprofit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Sales-Intervention-Complexity-Potential-Matrix-new.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/salesprofit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Sales-Intervention-Complexity-Potential-Matrix-new-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/salesprofit.in\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Sales-Intervention-Complexity-Potential-Matrix-new-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-8600b27 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"8600b27\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Many professionals responsible for Sales Enablement viz. Heads of Sales, Sales Enablement, L&amp;D, HR etc unknowingly invest alot of time\/ effort in the following Quadrants \u2013 <br>\u201cLow- Complexity\/ Low Potential Returns\u201d OR \u201cHigh complexity\/Low Potential Returns\u201d OR go ambitious and invest time in \u201cHigh Complexity\/High Potential Returns (without giving much thought to the implementation plan or ignoring it due to a variety of reasons )\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>The quadrant which gives an almost sure shot return is often the most ignored one. That is &#8211; the \u201cLow complexity\/High Returns\u201d Quadrant. We have named it as \u201cPrioritize\u201c quadrant.<\/p>\n<p>Few Examples: Sales CRM rollouts normally would sit in the \u201cPlan well\u201d quadrant for most sales organizations. (We have also seen it coming under \u201cHigh complexity\/Low Potential Returns\u201d for many companies when it\u2019s implemented in haste).<\/p>\n<p>At times, interventions like few \u201cPartner programs\u201d come under the \u201cHigh Complexity\/Low Potential Returns\u201d segment for many companies.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the interventions viz. \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/salesprofit.in\/blogs\/checklists-for-customer-meeting-preparation\/\" target=\"_blank\">Meeting Preparation<\/a>\u201d and \u201cOpportunity Qualification Scorecard\u201d often come under the \u201cPrioritize\u201d quadrant. They are relatively \u201cless complex\u201d to roll out and can positively contribute to Sales KPIs.<\/p>\n<p>For eg- Institutionalizing \u201cmeeting preparation\u201d means \u2013 bringing a culture of ensuring all sales professionals prepare in a structured manner for their customer meetings\/calls.<\/p>\n<p>However, most companies have not invested in institutionalizing them within their sales organization.<\/p>\n<p>Few interventions viz. Value messaging, Objection handling, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/salesprofit.in\/blogs\/5-steps-to-create-an-effective-elevator-pitch\/\" target=\"_blank\">Elevator Pitch<\/a>&nbsp;also can come under \u201cLow complexity\u201d rollouts for most companies. (As you would have realized, \u201ccomplexity to roll out\u201d differs from company to company. You should think from your company&#8217;s perspective ).<\/p>\n<p>In our&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/salesprofit.in\/services\/sales-training\/\" target=\"_blank\">B2B Sales Training<\/a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;Consulting interventions, when we brainstorm possible interventions which could eventually contribute to expected Sales Metrics, our objective is to identify interventions that would come under the \u201cPrioritize\u201d and \u201cPlan well\u201d quadrants.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPrioritize\u2019 interventions are encouraged to be implemented without much delay whereas \u201cPlan well\u201d interventions require planning, understanding of the risks associated, getting consent from leaders, setting expectations etc.<\/p>\n<p>If done well, this can get a big ROI for the customer. If not done\/planned well, it becomes a flavour of the month training and your \u201cbest\u201d sales reps become \u201cbetter\u201d whereas the \u201ccore of the sales team\u201d goes back to the original way of doing things.<\/p>\n<p>I hope the above matrix helps you in segregating your possible Sales Interventions and help you prioritize your time\/efforts and your organization\u2019s resources and avoid \u201csales interventions\u201d fizzling out from their original promise. <\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In my last few years of working with\u00a0B2B sales companies, I realized sales interventions ( be it Sales enablement or\u00a0Sales Consulting\u00a0) can fall into one of the following 4 quadrants.
