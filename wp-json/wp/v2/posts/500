Pareto\u2019s principle ( 80\/20) works with Sales Organization also, 20% Sales professionals normally bring &gt;60-70% of the deals. There are certain traits of great sales professionals that differentiate them from the rest. I want to talk about one of the traits in this blog. They respect their time, they respect their colleagues\u2019 time, value their organization resources and above all they remain customer focused.<\/p>\n<p><b>Great sales professionals know they can\u2019t win all deals; hence they identify their battles well. In Sales world, it is called as \u201cDeal Qualification\u201d Or \u201cOpportunity Qualification\u201d<\/b><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-b9a5833 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"b9a5833\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Let me share my thoughts on \u201cDeal Qualification\u201d<\/h2>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-888595d elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"888595d\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>There are methodologies viz BANT, MEDDIC, CHAMP etc. Nothing wrong with any of them. They all help uncover great deal of information that helps in qualifying in\/out the deal. I feel a sales professional needs some more information ( and it can be easily available provided sales professional asks those questions) to be almost sure whether he should pursue the deal or qualify it out.<\/p><p>I have created following questionnaire from my experience ( of Wins and Losses ) and have been using it since last few years and its helping me and my team uncover information which helps take a quick call on \u201cQualifying In or Out\u201d or to find more information before it can be \u201cQualified In\u201d. Deal Qualification is important for every sales guy and all the more for our sales friends who are in B2B Complex selling, where sales cycle is long, where deal value is high. Sales person\u2019s time is very important and he needs to spend it after right deals. Average Sales people get excited on every opportunity coming their way, Best remain focused on deals that are Qualified. Following questionnaire should also be useful for Entrepreneurs\/Business Owners who deal with B2B customers.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-a8b5c15 elementor-widget elementor-widget-heading\" data-id=\"a8b5c15\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"heading.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<h2 class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\">Questions you should try asking Customers (either in one call\/meeting or during subsequent conversations)<\/h2>\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-bb132c5 elementor-widget elementor-widget-text-editor\" data-id=\"bb132c5\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"text-editor.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul><li>What are customer\u2019s requirements?<\/li><li>What is\/are the reason\/s behind these requirements (i.e. what client wants to improve\/fix\/avoid)?<\/li><li>What is Customer\u2019s current infra?
