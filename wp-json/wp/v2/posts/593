Today, through this blog, I am sharing with you the lessons and understanding which we have gained and used.<\/p><p>There can also be more than one solution for your client\u2019s sales problem. For e.g.- A smaller funnel is a problem and potential solutions for it could be \u2013<\/p><ol><li>Train the sales team (a typical Sales training co. will always think that and suggest this to the customer)<\/li><li>Invest in marketing (marketing agencies, digital marketing cos. will go down this route)<\/li><li>Add more no. of employee\u2019s sales team or add more channel partners<\/li><li>Invest in a technology platform (a Sales\/Marketing tech co. will suggest this)<\/li><li>Engage a consulting company (a Sales Consulting company would come out with this solution).<\/li><\/ol><p>All the above solutions (and a few more not listed here) suggested are neither right nor wrong. Just that each provider is (perhaps) pushing her solution (They need not be blamed. Many of them might have ignorance about other possible solutions for the same client problem).
