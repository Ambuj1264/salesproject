With their limited experience \/ knowledge level, it\u2019s not prudent to expect them to identify right target segment. <b><u>Its management\u2019s responsibility to clearly define \u201cICP\u201d for their frontline sales\/marketing\/inside-sales team.<\/u><\/b><\/p><p>I equate ICP to a \u201cField of Play\u2019 or \u201cBoundaries\u2019 we all define whenever we play an outdoor sport. ( eg. Cricket\/Football etc). Boundaries clearly tell us \u2013 that players are supposed to play inside this and the play area within these boundaries would remain the focus of our sports activities.<\/p><p>The same is true for ICP. It should be the focus of all our Proactive sales\/marketing efforts. There may be opportunities that the sales team may still receive ( they are known as Reactive opportunities) which may fall outside the Selling Organization\u2019s ICP. The sales team can take a call on a case-to-case basis whether they want to pursue them or not. However proactive efforts should be solely on the Selling Organization\u2019s ICP segment\/accounts.<\/p><p>I initially thought that ICP must be getting followed almost by every organization. However, my last few year\u2019s experiences of working with Sales leaders\/founders made me realize that \u2013 many companies, unfortunately don\u2019t have clear ICP defined for their products\/services.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p><strong>Let me give an example of ICP for one of our services<\/strong> \u2013 \u201cSales Recruitment\u201d where we help our customers close their \u201csales positions\u201d.<\/p><p>ICP should be easy to understand, and it should be written from your frontline sales\/marketing colleague\u2019s point of view. Eventually, they are the ones who would be reaching out to the prospects via email\/call\/Linkedin etc.<\/p><p>Coming back to my example \u2013 Our \u201cSales Recruitment\u201d ICP is defined as \u2013<\/p><p><em><strong>(1) Technology &amp; telecom companies<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><em><strong>(2) With either &gt; 300 employees and less than 5000 employees OR &gt; 10 member sales team<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><em><strong>(3) Who want to close sales positions for India region.<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p><em><strong>(4). CTC should be &gt; 9 Lacs P.a<\/strong><\/em><\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>So, anything outside the above should not be the focus of the frontline team. They should focus their efforts to only those companies who fit into above criteria. Once a company is in their ICP, sales team should go aggressive to pursue them. Even clients would find value as over time, sales organization would have multiple customer references, best practices of the same vertical.<\/p><p><strong>Your first cut ICP should have clarity on the following :<\/strong><\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-element elementor-element-32a128e elementor-widget elementor-widget-eael-advanced-data-table\" data-id=\"32a128e\" data-element_type=\"widget\" data-widget_type=\"eael-advanced-data-table.default\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"elementor-widget-container\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"ea-advanced-data-table-wrap\" data-id=\"32a128e\"><div class=\"ea-advanced-data-table-wrap-inner\">\n                <table class=\"ea-advanced-data-table ea-advanced-data-table-static ea-advanced-data-table-32a128e\" data-id=\"32a128e\"><thead><tr><th style=\"width: 212px\"><p>Criteria<\/p><\/th><th style=\"width: 165px\"><p>Details<\/p><\/th><th><p>Remarks<\/p><\/th><\/tr><\/thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Revenue of the target company<\/p><\/td><td><p>Minimum :<\/p><p>Maximum :<\/p><\/td><td><p>We need to be true to ourselves.

It\u2019s like understanding the \u201cbasics of Mathematics\u201d well, before we were taught Algebra &amp; Geometry, during our school days.<\/p><p>Once 1st phase is done, leaders can further improvise the ICP by bringing \u201cPsychographics\u201d and other categories.<\/p><p>I read it somewhere \u2013 \u201cDirection is more important than speed\u201d.<\/p><p>ICP should be the direction of all Sales efforts. Or else sales team will move into wrong customer accounts\/segment. This will eventually not help Sales Organization grow to its optimum scale.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p>I suggest my customers \u2013 to bring sanity to following 3 items if you want to transform your sales culture.<\/p><ol><li>Define clear ICP<\/li><li>Enable team with clear criteria for \u201cOpportunity Qualification\u201d<\/li><li>Bring in meeting preparation culture.<\/li><\/ol><p>All above are very much executable and in 3 months, once can see a significant change in Sales DNA.<\/p><p>If you want to have a call with me to understand more, will be happy to share my learnings.<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I have come across umpteen no. of entrepreneurs and sales leaders who expect their sales\/ inside sales team to go figure out their ICP and win new customers.
